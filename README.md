I have made a Snake Game using HTML5 , CSS and Javascript. In this game I have created a square pad on which game will run. Inside that pad an object "FOOD" and a "SNAKE" is created. As Snake eats the food its size increases by 1 box and Score point of player also increases by 1. Snake can move in all directions. And if snake touches its own body or touches any of its 4 boundaries of pad, the game gets over.
